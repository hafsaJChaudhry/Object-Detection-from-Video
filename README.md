# Object-Detection-from-Video
Video object detection and video segmentation using YOLOv8 - developed by Ultralytics. Detects and identifies objects in a video by breaking the video down into frame by frame stills. So far YOLOv8 can identify ~80 objects. Video I am testing: soccer game. Objects detected: players (0:persons) and soccer ball (32:sports item)
